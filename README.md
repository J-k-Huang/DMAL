## Benchmark
* Digits contains three datasets: MNIST], USPS, and SVHN. 
* Office-31 contains 4652 images across 31 classes from three domains: Amazon (A), DSLR (D), and Webcam (W). Office-31 dataset can be found [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/)
* Office-Home contains 15 500 images of 65 classes from four domains: Ar, Cl, Pr, and Rw. Office-Home dataset can be found [here](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html)
* ImageCLEF-DA contains 12 common classes shared by three domains: C, I, and P.
* VisDA-2017  is a simulation-to-real dataset for domain adaptation over 280 000 images across 12 categories. VisDA-2017 dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/taskcv-2017-public)
* DomainNet consists of about 0.6 million images with 345 classes.
